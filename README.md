 ðŸ“„ README â€“ AI-Powered Web Navigator Agent  

 a) Problem Statement Reference  

 Problem Statement Chosen  
Develop an AI-powered Web Navigator Agent that can automatically browse, extract, and summarize web content based on user queries.  

 Reason to Choose the Problem Statement  
- Manual searching is time-consuming and often leads to irrelevant results.  
- An AI agent can automate browsing, fetch structured insights, and provide personalized answers efficiently.  
- Useful for students, researchers, and professionals to quickly gather information.  



 b) Solution Overview  

 Proposed Approach  
The AI Web Navigator Agent integrates an LLM with web automation and scraping APIs. It interprets user queries, navigates through relevant web pages, extracts content, and summarizes it into concise, meaningful answers.  

 Key Features / Modules  
1. Query Understanding Module â€“ LLM for intent detection and keyword extraction.  
2. Web Navigation Module â€“ Automated browsing & crawling with Selenium/Playwright.  
3. Content Extraction Module â€“ Scraping structured/unstructured data.  
4. Summarization Module â€“ AI-based summarizer for concise answers.  
5. User Interface â€“ Dashboard/chat UI for user interaction.  


 c) System Architecture  

 Architecture Workflow  
1. User enters query in frontend.  
2. Query Understanding Module (LLM) interprets intent.  
3. Web Navigation Module fetches and scrapes relevant web pages.  
4. Extracted raw data is cleaned, structured, and passed to Summarization.  
5. Summarizer generates concise response.  
6. Final answer displayed on frontend dashboard/chatbot UI.

 Data Flow Explanation  
- Input: User query.  
- Processing: Intent detection â†’ Navigation â†’ Extraction â†’ Summarization.  
- Output: Clean, summarized response.  



 d) Technology Stack  

- Backend: Python (Django)  
- Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Databases: SQLite / PostgreSQL (for storing queries & results)  
- ML/AI Frameworks: Transformers (Hugging Face), Ollama, T5/GPT-based models  
- APIs / Libraries: Selenium, Playwright, Requests  



 e) Algorithms & Models  

 Algorithm(s) Chosen  
- LLM: Transformer-based models (GPT, Ollama) for query understanding.  
- Web Navigation: Selenium/Playwright for automated crawling.  
- Summarization: Pre-trained abstractive models (T5/GPT).  

 Reason for Choice  
- Transformers achieve state-of-the-art query comprehension.  
- Selenium/Playwright handle both static and dynamic pages effectively.  
- Pre-trained summarization ensures concise, meaningful insights.  

 Model Training & Testing Approach  
- Use pre-trained models (transfer learning).  
- Fine-tune with small domain-specific datasets if needed.  
- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing.  


 f) Data Handling  

- Data Sources Used: Live websites, APIs, scraped content.  
- Preprocessing Methods: Cleaning HTML tags, tokenization, deduplication.  
- Storage / Pipeline Setup: Temporary storage in DB; structured data pipeline.  



 g) Implementation Plan  

1. Initial Setup & Environment  
   - Install required frameworks: Python, Django, React.js.  
   - Configure APIs, environment variables.  

2. Core Module Development  
   - Query Understanding (LLM).  
   - Web Navigation & Scraping.  
   - Summarization & Answer Generation.  

3. Integration & Testing  
   - Connect frontend with backend APIs.  
   - Test API calls, response formats, error handling.  

4. Final Deployment-ready Build  
   - Deploy frontend on Vercel/Netlify.  
   - Backend on cloud server (AWS/Heroku/Render).  



 h) Performance & Validation  

 Evaluation Metrics  
- Accuracy: Correctness of fetched/summarized info.  
- Response Time: Time taken to fetch & summarize.  
- Relevance: Precision of summarized information.  

 Testing Strategy  
- Integration Testing: Ensure modules (LLM + Navigation + Summarizer) work together.  
- System Testing: Validate AI agent against requirements.  
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Test with real user queries.  



 i) Deployment & Scalability  

 Deployment Plan  
- Frontend â†’ Vercel / Netlify.  
- Backend (Django + APIs) â†’ Cloud (AWS/Heroku/Render).  

 Scalability Considerations  
- Stateless APIs: Independent request handling.  
- Modular Design: Separate LLM, navigation, and summarization services.  
- Caching: Store frequent queries to reduce load.
